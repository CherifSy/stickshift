# stickshift

A clean & modern data interface.

## Features

* **Export** query results to JSON & CSV
* **Visualize** some query results automatically
* **Share** and save queries
* **Responsive** on lil' screens

## Installation

* `npm install`
* copy [config.example.json](config.example.json) to `config.json`
  and configure it with a repository to use for query storage and an
  endpoint for queries.
* the example in [example_server.js](example_server.js) talks to SQLite,
  but you can swap in Postgres/RedShift using the `pg` module,
  MySQL using the `mysql` module, and so on. Or you can even just point
  stickshift that accepts queries over POST and returns results as JSON
* `npm start`

## Architecture

`stickshift` is built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/),
and [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). It's written
in CommonJS & ES6 and cross-compiled with [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
& [6to5](https://6to5.org/). Query storage is powered by [hubdb](http://github.com/mapbox/hubdb).

## Bring your own auth

There's no user login system built into `stickshift`: like your choice of
database, this is likely to be specific to your purpose, company, usage,
and so on. Some common approaches include:

* Running it locally or behind a firewall
* Ditching `example_server.js` and integrating with a server that does
  authentication, like through passport. This is what we do at Mapbox.

## Charts

`stickshift` automatically creates charts for applicable queries: those
that

* Have a column parseable as dates
* Have at least one other column of numbers

These charts are rendered with [Vega](https://github.com/trifacta/vega).
They're designed for exploratory data analysis, so are relatively simple.
